## International FOSS4G 2017
===========
These are my personal notes from FOSS4G 2017. At the previous FOSS4G I lost a days worth of notes while using the free version of Evernote. This time I will be using GitHub and a Jekyll theme I built off the Pavilion CSS homepage.

The index page is built from a yaml file.

## Theme - pavilion-wiki
A Jekyll Wiki-Like template based heavily on the homepage of Pavilion CSS
